This is the Module of this project which provides an interface for the Parking Space Management Company to monitor the Parking Lots.
At every point in time, the current status of each parking space is kept updated with a number of information about the vehicle in it.
Such information include:
1. Occupied or Empty
   This is a status which informs on whether there is currently a vehicle in a specific parking space or not.
2. Licence Plate Number
   This is the Licence Plate of the vehicle detected by the OCR software from Azure.
3. Paid or Unpaid
   This is a status which informs on whether or not a Vehicle whose licence plate has been detected in a particular parking Space has actually made payment for parking.
4. Date and Time
   This shows the exact time at which the last check on the Parking Space was carried out by the Robot.
   
 
 All of this Checks information is fetched from an API(  )
